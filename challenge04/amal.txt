This challenged laid a good foundation for my team and I to begin working on the project. 
With this challenge we were able to understand the basics of new softwares and familiarize
ourselves with new APIs and C#. We also watched some videos on how to program a game using
Unity.

Team-wide Logs:
Discuss who does what, worked on individual milestone (1 hr)
Discuss how Unity and github workflow are gonna work (1hr)

My Logs:
Downloaded and familiarized with Unity editor basics (1hr)
Familiarized with Unity API scripts (1hr)
Watched introductory videos to making a 2D game (1 hr)
Watched basic C# intro videos (.5hr)

Next steps appear to be figuring out how to organize scripts efficiently. 
We will figure out how to implement core features of the game such as gameplay 
and movement. Later we will figure out how to add texture and design.
